# World_War_K
2D Space Invader-esque Java Game.

Created in a group of 3 developers. Goal was to practice and reinforce knowledge of 
Java Programming as well as grasph polymorphism and inheritance of classes.

Most of the art and sound assets were made by ourselves, the enemies are supposed to 
progressively get more difficult depending on the scoreboard. Very simple, simple graphics,
simple concept, simple controls, simple enemies. SIMPLE!

Thanks for checking this project out!
